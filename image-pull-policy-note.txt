oc create deployment mmm quay.io/bkthong/serviceb:1.6 
--> because tag is not latest (1.6 in this case), the image pull policy is IfNotPresent
- this results in mme getting the older image if the older version of the 1.6 tag was present
  already in the cluster
  - it does not check the shasum again
- NEED to change this to Always, so that it double-checks the checksum and reddownloads if there is a 
  newer version
